# PORTFOLIO CASE INDEX

This document defines how each QA Architecture case is represented inside the QA-DELIVERY-CONTROL-CENTER-PORTO workspace.

Its purpose is to bridge:

- GitHub case narratives
- Workbook-based execution samples
- Evidence packs prepared for portfolio use

All artifacts in this workspace are curated, anonymized, and intended for professional portfolio presentation.

---

## 1. Portfolio Mapping Principle

The portfolio workspace is not a copy of the original QA Delivery Control Center.

It is a curated proof layer designed to show:

- How QA operates as a control function
- How real execution artifacts support architectural cases
- How business intent, system behavior, and QA decisions are connected

## 2. Case Overview

| Case ID | Case Title | Primary Focus | Portfolio Goal |
|--------|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| CASE-01 | Multi-role Flow Consistency | State & data consistency across Admin and Agent | Show control over operational flow integrity |
| CASE-02 | Calculation Validation | Business logic correctness | Show control over high-risk calculation logic |
| CASE-03 | Integration Failure | Data delivery completeness | Show control over integration and data usability |
| CASE-04 | Async Delay | Timing and event consistency | Show control over delivery timing risk |
| CASE-05 | Data Contract Conflict | Data structure and source of truth | Show control over data definition and validation boundary |

---

## 3. Workbook Source Mapping

| Case ID | Source Workbook | Target Portfolio Folder | Expected Sample Type |
|--------|------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| CASE-01 | QA_LOG, DEV_WORK_FE/BE, RHYTHM_CONTROL | 02_WORKBOOK_SAMPLES | State mismatch sample |
| CASE-02 | QA_LOG_RBI, CALCULATION_CONTROL | 02_WORKBOOK_SAMPLES | Calculation validation sample |
| CASE-03 | QA_LOG, DEV_WORK_DB | 02_WORKBOOK_SAMPLES | Integration failure sample |
| CASE-04 | RHYTHM_CONTROL, QA_CHECKPOINT_LOG | 02_WORKBOOK_SAMPLES | Delay observation sample |
| CASE-05 | QA_LOG, CALCULATION_CONTROL | 02_WORKBOOK_SAMPLES | Data contract / missing field sample |

---

## 4. Evidence Mapping

| Case ID | Expected Evidence |
|--------|-------------------|
| CASE-01 | Dashboard vs DB mismatch, status inconsistency |
| CASE-02 | Expected vs actual calculation output, formula validation illustration |
| CASE-03 | Incomplete WO detail, sanitized data injection example |
| CASE-04 | Delay timeline, asynchronous visibility issue |
| CASE-05 | Missing field example, source-of-truth conflict illustration |

---

## 5. Proof Readiness Status

| Case ID | GitHub Narrative | Workbook Sample | Evidence Pack | Status |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|--------------|--------|
| CASE-01 | Ready | Pending | Pending | In Progress |
| CASE-02 | Ready | Pending | Pending | In Progress |
| CASE-03 | Ready | Pending | Pending | In Progress |
| CASE-04 | Ready | Pending | Pending | In Progress |
| CASE-05 | Ready | Pending | Pending | In Progress |

## 6. Workspace Rule

All portfolio artifacts must follow these rules:

1. No real customer data
2. No real client identifiers
3. No full raw export from internal workbook
4. Samples must be sufficient to prove QA reasoning and execution flow
5. Every artifact must be traceable back to a case

---

## 7. Objective

This workspace is intended to demonstrate that the QA Architecture portfolio is supported by real operational artifacts.

The final objective is to show:

- QA thinking in GitHub
- QA execution in workbook samples
- QA proof in evidence packs

Together, these form a complete QA Operating System portfolio.
